### Research levels

| Category | Emoji | Time Commitment & Activities |
| :------- | :---- | :--------------------------- |
| **Understanding** | üßë‚Äçüéì | Dedicate over **two hours weekly** to stay updated on significant changes and developments in **blockchain and Ethereum**, such as tracking and understanding Beamchain. Share these insights through popular science articles and videos. |
| **Research** | ü§ø | Spend more than **five hours weekly** on future feature demands, requiring continuous follow-up with code and academic papers. Examples include monitoring **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and **lattice-based computing** use cases. |
| **Development** | üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Allocate over **30 hours weekly** to product design, research, and development, aiming to achieve planned roadmap milestones. This includes creating proposals and detailed documentation, along with weekly progress tracking and feature feedback. |

### Research documents üìÇ

| Focus Area                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
