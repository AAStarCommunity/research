# Research V0.2 :rocket:

[中文版](README_CN.md) [English](README.md)

Now we try to build a open research repo for AA and related topics in 2025,
replace the collection on notion.

[Join here](https://github.com/AAStarCommunity/research/issues) Just open a new
issue, begin to do something, then send a PR and we will review and publish your
topics or any contributions :carrot:.

All contributions are welcome and will be put into
[review](https://github.com/AAStarCommunity/research/review).

This repo will publish at
[https://www.aastar.io/research](https://www.aastar.io/research).

Welcome to any researcher to contribute for related topics. Just for and send a
pull request(PR), we will review and publish your topics or any contributions
🥕.

## Research area :scientist:

### Research levels

- Understanding: 🧑‍🎓

Keep Informed: Dedicate over two hours weekly to stay updated on significant
changes and developments in blockchain and Ethereum, such as tracking and
understanding Beamchain. Share these insights through popular science articles
and videos.

- Research: 🤿

Deep Dive: Spend more than five hours weekly on future feature demands,
requiring continuous follow-up with code and academic papers. Examples include
monitoring Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and lattice-based computing use
cases.

- Development: 👷‍♂️

Product & Engineering: Allocate over 30 hours weekly to product design,
research, and development, aiming to achieve planned roadmap milestones. This
includes creating proposals and detailed documentation, along with weekly
progress tracking and feature feedback.

### Research documents 📂

- Articles 🎯

Publish ongoing analyses and summaries on public media, covering both the
"Understanding" and "Research" levels.

- Roadmap and Milestones 🏷️

Plan and publicize the roadmap and key milestones, ideally with usable
applications for public experience.

- Journal 📚

Core development projects should include rigorous academic papers for arXiv and
journal submissions. Initial drafts can proceed to design and iteration after
peer review, with publication potentially happening later.

- Solution 💯 Solutions must integrate insights from academic papers, industry
  research, protocol visions, specific problems, and our proposed approaches.
  They should undergo at least three rounds of in-depth AI analysis, review, and
  refinement.

- Features 🎁

Break down solutions into specific product features that are modular and
combinable within the overall product. Focus on both user experience (UX) and
impact, aiming for at least three significant updates and breakthroughs in
addressing problems.

- Plan ✅

Outline how features will be developed, tested, deployed, maintained, scaled,
load-balanced, made fault-tolerant, protected against hacker attacks, and backed
up/recovered.

- Deploy 🏭

Detail deployment and installation procedures for different environments,
including service architecture and clients. This covers compatibility across
various versions, hardware/software, and environments.

- Changes 👽

Document noteworthy changes and updates for each new feature.

## Research v0.1(deprecated) :camping:

~~Task board is here:
https://github.com/Ethereum-Star/Research/blob/main/task-board.md~~

No founders, just contributors.

Research on Ethereum Accounts related

~~SoulWallet，Plancker联合发起，建设和服务以太坊的公共物品国际化组织，名字暂定：Ethereum
Star。~~ We consensus with the name: AA Star! Help AA to practice the Mass
Adoption roadmap of Ethereum!

目前提案建立AA Global
Group，建立自己Github，网站（独立）和论坛（可公用plancker的），以及bounty（可公用plancker的），在各个AA社区宣传自己理念和公共物品产出和积极参与贡献。

依靠社区来撬动更多力量，为AA生态提供公共物品/服务，繁荣生态，持续深入发展：

用户画像：不同环境，不同文化，不同地区的钱包诉求和UX匹配，调研分析和痛点提炼

行业分析：AA生态未来可持续探讨，应用和钱包的深度结合：no-interface-wallet

课题研究：安全案例梳理和研究，钱包安全模型，AA模块化（插件机制，Lib机制，Guardian管理等等）

Workshop：SMS钱包，Email钱包，日限额插件（20多个插件可workshop）

Hackathon组队：基于workshop，进行产品化，组件小组，参加全球黑客松

建设力量来源：招募+bounty+兼职+全职

资金来源+回报：Grant，未来追溯（DAO化/内部项目投资机会）

---

第一期：6个月，目标：

建立初始团队和可信中立的社区规则，取一个名字，为建立DAO做准备

两个国家/地区深度调研，提取画像，给出痛点

行业分析两篇：各典型应用的发展趋势和AA参与加速的机会可能

插件等三个机制+开源的模块贡献，EIP准备（钱包切换标准，public
guardian标准，promotion标准）

两个钱包Demo

参加至少一次hackathon并入围（拿奖）

努力用可信中立的方式，启动一个垂直建设的工作组（DAO）：

1.Don’t write specific people or specific outcomes into the mechanism

2.Open source and publicly verifiable execution

3.Keep it simple

4.Don’t change it too often, while considering the principle of efficacy with
shelling fancy for the failure-safe feasible mechanism for the moment and keep
striving to get closer to credible neutrality.
